# Ode to McDonald's Unpredictable Ice Cream Machine

_"You can't buy happiness, but you can buy ice cream and that is pretty much the same thing." —_ Unknown

There's no other feeling like eating soft serve ice cream on a hot summer's day

You can't complain

Every lick brings ease to the soul

Although your brain might experience pain

It's all the same

There is more to gain

Sometimes, after a long day of playing soccer

My father would ask the question

"Do you want some McDonald's soft serve?"

My heart would start to race

And not because we just gone face-to-face

But because I already knew

"Yes…please!" was my answer

My eyes were on the look out for those Big Yellow Arches

There usually was one around every other corner

When we reached the drive thru line

We had to be patient

When it was our turn

My father told the server our order

"Can I get 3 ice cream cones?"

The extra one was for my sister

There was hesitation in the server's answer

Then the news came that the ice cream machine was currently out of order

My hopes shattered

My thoughts were all scattered

"How could this be?"

"Isn't McDonald's the world's most popular fast food chain, shouldn't they have everything in order?"

We went home right after

With no soft serve in hand

From that day and on

Transpired multiple instances of the same experience

"I'm sorry miss, our machine isn't working right now"

"Hi Ma'am, I can't place that order for you because out machine is broken at the moment"

Though it felt like the world was against me

The times that made me forget about all the past bummers was when the server responded

"Okay, would you like anything else with that?"
