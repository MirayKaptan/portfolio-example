# Ode to the Vulnerable Aisles of a Department Store 

There are two types of shoppers

The first type are one dimensional

It feels like they are on a mission

To quickly go in

Get what they need

And get out

Without being noticed

Plain and simple as that

The second type are well rounded

They are the ones who are submerged in the experience of shopping

They take it all in

They critique the decorations

Or the mannequin in the store

They start to analyze other customers

And judging their choices

However

Which ever one you may or may not identify with

They all have something in common

All experience similar feelings in certain aisles

Can you guess which aisles?

I'll give you a hint

What aisles make you feel

Akward

Embarrassed

Ashamed

Uncomfortable

There is no right answer

Every person has their own vulnerable aisle

Whether it be the pads, tampons, or condoms section

The underwear, bra, and lingerie section

The rash or wort removal section

The deodorant and shaver section

The list goes on

Acknowledging those feelings

Is the first step of overcoming them
