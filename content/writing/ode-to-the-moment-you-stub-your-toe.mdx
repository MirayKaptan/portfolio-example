# Ode to the Moment You Stub Your Toe

You are minding your own business

When it hit

The pain

The excruciating pain

A screech starts to formulate in your mouth

A sense of anger boils in your blood

A tear develops in the corner of your eye

You look down

And you see that youâ€¦

Stubbed your toe

You think to yourself

"How was I so careless?"

This isn't the first time it's happened to you

But it hasn't happened in a while

Because you told yourself the last time it happened

It will never happen again

That you would be more careful

That you would not be wiggling your toes aimlessly

That each step would be taken with grace and stride

In that split second

It felt like the whole world was going to end

A few seconds later the throbbing passes

Your toe regains consciousness

And you continue on with your day

Forgetting the trauma you experienced
