# Ode to the Pronunciation of my Name

When the time comes again

To introduce myself to someone new

I have one second to decide

Which name do I choose?

The pronunciation of my name

May be difficult for some

In Arabic, the name means "most beautiful"

A little pretentious if you ask me

But hey, what can I do

It was the name given to me

But technically speaking

I could change it if I wanted to

My family say it one way

And my friends say another

My boss keeps changing it

And my teachers didn't even bother

Funnily enough

I wouldn't want it any other way

I am comfortable with who I am

That no matter how close or far someone maybe

As long as they understand me
