# Ode to Finding a Dollar in Your Pocket

Pockets

One of the most underrated inventions

Imagine a world without pockets

There would be no place to put your keys

Or your wallet

Your loose change

Or your gum wrapper

Your hands when they're cold

Or when they have no where else to go

Pockets

They have inadvertently revolutionized society

It has reduced people's stress levels

It has brought safety and comfort

And most of all

It has flourished an event

That rarely occurs

And when it does

You stop to rejoice

And smile

This happens usually

On a completely random day

You chose to wear a pair of pants

That are special in some kind of way

But you do not know it yet

You go on with your day

Until the moment comes

Your hand goes into your pocket

To put something away

To your surprise

You discover a crumpled up dollar bill in it's place

Your eyes can't believe it

You try to think back to how it got there

But in that moment

It did not matter

What mattered was that it was there

You uncrumple the dollar

Give it a sweet kiss

Hoping to find more another day
