# Ode to the Lint in your Belly Button

Once the epicenter of your existence

It provided you strength and nourishment

It allowed you to survive in the confinement of your mother's womb

It connected you to the line called "life"

The mark left behind

Is an ever lasting reminder

Of the journey your essence endured

To join the ranks of humanity

Ironically, it's pure existence is easily neglected

It's either covered up by clothes

Or pierced by jewelry

However, more importantly

The findings inside are rarely discussed

A personal dilemma many people approach

With extreme hesitancy

Whether to explore the depths of it or not

Past findings have been catastrophic

After that one sniff sent you to the prehistoric

Ultimately you have no other choice

You must attack it onward

But make sure you do it quick

So nothing gets stuck there for long

And affects the substances of it all
