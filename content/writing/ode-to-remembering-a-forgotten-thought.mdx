# Ode to Remembering a Forgotten Thought

On average

The human brain has around 6,200 thoughts per day

Most of these thoughts are

Fleeting

Ephemeral

Momentary

Ironically

The human brain also has up to 2.5 petabytes of space

A petabyte is about 1,000 terabytes

And a terabyte is equal to about 1,000 gigabytes

But by the time you get to this sentence

You probably won't remember what you read

Only a few sentences ago

Because of all the thoughts you were focusing on before

And that's okay

You are only human

When the time comes

To remember a forgotten thought

Stop and

Be patient

Take a deep breath

And let go of your frustration

Understand that your are only human

And only time will tell

Whether your thought can be rescued

From the depths of your black hole
