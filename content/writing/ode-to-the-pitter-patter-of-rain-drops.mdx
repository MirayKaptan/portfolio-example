# Ode to the Pitter Patter of Rain Drops

It is 12 am

My eyes are slowly drifting off

Into the abyss

The last audible sound left

Is the rumbling of my stomach

I scrunch myself tight to my blanket

Tighter than a crumbled up piece of paper

So no heat can escape

From the chasm of my bed

When my mind was about to surrender to the night

A light flashes through my window blinds

It hit my eye lids

Temporarily leaving me flummoxed

A few seconds pass

To what then follows

A cry from the sky

It starts off faint and distant

Until a few moments later

It was in the corner of my ear

Then the arrival of the pitter patters

Pit, pat, pit, pat

Synchronized

Never off beat

Pit, pat, pit, pat

Dreams of the pit, pat, pit, pat

Melodies began to appear

The night became much lighter
