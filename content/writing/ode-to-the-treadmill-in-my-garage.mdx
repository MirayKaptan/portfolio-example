# Ode to the Treadmill in My Garage

Months and months went by

I had you on my mind

I'd pass you in the gym

Being used by many of them

Never had the chance to take a spin

Finally when I got to take a ride

My time flew by

This was different than running outside

I didn't need to worry about the bugs getting in my eye

I didn't need to worry about the sun burning my skin

I didn't need to worry about the rain wetting my cloths

I only needed to worry about the pain from with in

Then a thought came to mind

Why don't I get one of mine?

A few months later I found the One

When I clicked the button for you to be on your way

I couldn't wait until you came

I dreamt about all the miles we'd share

Until the day you came

When you arrived that day

I couldn't wait for you to stay

We'd be running everyday

With the intention of completing a marathon someday

It was a struggle in the beginning

To build up the stamina and the habit was a challenge

Slowly it became more natural and easier

My mind was getting a lot more clearer

However, just when I was getting into the flow

Life happened

Everyday turned into every few days

Every few days became weeks

And weeks became months

Oh I had such high hopes for you

I had a plan that I would make the most of you

Now your just sitting there in my garage

Taking the space of another car

Waiting to be used by someone again
