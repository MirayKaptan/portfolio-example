# Ode to the Clothes in your Closet
 
Your belongings

From your polka dot socks

To your tie dye underwear

From your lint filled cotton T-shirt

To your "I don't care" fuzzy sweatshirt

From your too tight skinny jeans

To your too loose bootcut jeans

From your favorite comfy denim jean jacket

To your restrictive and afflictive leather jacket

With these

How do you maintain your identity?

Did you choose each item based on who you wanted to be?

Or did you get peer pressured by society?

Regardless of how it ended up in your closet

Each one has people, memories, and experiences attached to them

Whether it be the jersey of your favorite player from your first soccer game

Or the blouse your grandma gave you on your birthday

Or the hoodie you won from a random university giveaway

Or the beanie that took you 10 hours to make

Each one is unique in it's own way

And only you understand why

It's pretty incredible if you ask me

When it's time to get rid of clothes

To make space for new ones

You are also slowly letting go of those memories

To then be replaced with new ones
