# Ode to the Lost Remotes Out There

Why does it feel like

When we need you the most

You are no where to be found

And when you are not needed at all

You are right there

In your designated spot

How is it

That we look everywhere

For hours

And not cross paths

Until we check again

And you are nonchalantly relaxing

Inside the sliver of the sofa cushions

You put us through the motions

Of aggravation and frustration

And right when we are about to concede

We find you

A wave of relief runs through our veins

Our faces dumbfounded

I have one question

What did we do to deserve this

Unpredictable endless cycle of torment
