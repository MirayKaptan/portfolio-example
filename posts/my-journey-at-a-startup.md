As an embedded systems engineer at an agtech startup, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects. But, as I dove deeper into my role, I quickly realized that things were not as clear as I had hoped. And let me tell you, it was a tough lesson to learn. But, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Because, I learned a ton of valuable lessons that I want to share with you.

The first and probably the most important lesson I learned was the power of clear communication. When everyone is on the same page, it's amazing what a team can accomplish. But, when people are confused or unclear about the company's mission and goals, it can be a recipe for disaster. This was something that I realized while reading "Start with Why" by Simon Sinek. It's a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the importance of aligning everyone's actions and decisions with the company's purpose.

Another thing I learned was that startups aren't always a walk in the park. Sure, they can be exciting and full of potential. But, they can also be full of red flags that are overlooked or excused because of the startup's small size and lack of resources. So, don't be fooled. Just because a startup is small, it doesn't mean that it's exempt from having certain standards and expectations.

One more thing I learned was that success can sometimes attract negative attention. When I had a string of successes, I found that others in the company became jealous and made my work life difficult. This was a valuable lesson in terms of how to handle difficult coworkers and how to maintain a professional demeanor in the face of negativity.

Another thing I learned was the importance of not participating in company gossip. Gossip can be one of the most unproductive and worst things for a startup. It can create a toxic environment and can hinder productivity and progress.

Lastly, I learned the importance of ensuring that a company has a revenue source. It's vital for a startup to have at least some evidence that their product or service is something that people are interested in. It's important to be able to see that the company is making progress and that there is a potential for growth.

In conclusion, my journey at a startup was full of ups and downs. But, I wouldn't trade it for anything. The lessons I learned were invaluable. I hope that by sharing my experience, I can help others avoid some of the mistakes I made. Remember, clear communication is key, don't overlook red flags, be careful when you succeed, stay away from gossip and make sure the company has a revenue source. These are the things I wish I knew when I started my journey at a startup. Good luck on yours!
